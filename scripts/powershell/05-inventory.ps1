# Step 5. The Genesys version of the AWS cost-guard. Read-only.
# Genesys is billed by licence and usage under your contract, not by the hour, so there is no "meter" to stop.
# What you CAN check is how many lab objects exist, and whether anything is left after a destroy.

Say "Objects in the org (all, not only lab)"

Show-Count 'Knowledge bases' '/api/v2/knowledge/knowledgebases?pageSize=1'

Say "Queues with the $Prefix prefix (lab objects)"
$q = Invoke-GenesysGet "/api/v2/routing/queues?pageSize=100&name=$Prefix*"
foreach ($e in @($q.entities)) { "  $($e.name)" }

Say "Reminder"
'  - Check usage and charges in Genesys Admin > Billing, and in your contract.'
'  - A leftover phone number or add-on licence is where lab cost hides, not the queues.'
