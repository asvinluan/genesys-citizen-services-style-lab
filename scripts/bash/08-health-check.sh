# This is the L2 "is the platform healthy and is what we built still there?" check.
# Exit code 0 = all good, 1 = at least one FAIL. WARN does not fail the run.

# HONEST NOTE: written against the public Genesys Cloud API shapes and tested only against a local mock server,
# never a live org. If a field name differs in your org, the check will say so. Fix it and note it in the run log.
# It looks at the first 100 objects of each kind. That is enough for a lab; a big org needs paging.
