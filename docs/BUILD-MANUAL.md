# Build manual: Citizen Services-style lab on Genesys Cloud

How the build is done, step by step, and **why** each step is there. Written for a tired reader: short sentences, one action per step, and a "you should see" after each one.

Two companion documents hold the exact commands:

- **Runbook, PowerShell** (Windows): `RUNBOOK-POWERSHELL.md`
- **Runbook, Bash** (Linux, macOS, WSL, CI): `RUNBOOK-BASH.md`

Pick one. They do the same thing. The ideas behind the build are in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. How to run it day to day is in `OPERATIONS-AND-ON-CALL.md`.

> **Honest status.** The Terraform passes `validate` against the real Genesys provider schema and an offline plan test with the provider mocked. It has never been applied to a live org. Expect the first `plan` or `apply` to find a few small errors (a permission string, a field name). That is normal for a first run and it is what the plan step is for. Fix them in the code, not in the screen.

## Part 0. What you are building

This is a **Citizen Services-style lab**. It is **not** any real government agency and nothing here describes any real organisation's systems, queues, numbers or controls. It is modelled on the *kind* of public contact service a national citizen-services agency runs, using general public knowledge only. Phone numbers are from the range Australia reserves for TV and film (03 5550 xxxx). "Restricted Reports" is a **stand-in** for any queue handling information at a higher classification; it is a design device, not a claim about how any real organisation works.

- 4 phone numbers (see the table in the Architecture document, section 6.4).
- 9 queues with widening agent pools, and surge rules on the busiest.
- Open, closed and holiday behaviour on the business-hours lines.
- A surge switch that repoints the lines that allow it.
- A restricted division and queue, kept out of the reach of builders and publishers.
- A knowledge base, a virtual agent with guardrails, and speech analytics.
- Quality forms with kill questions, a recording retention policy, and a workforce management unit.
- Website chat that only your own site can load.
- Optional organisation-wide sign-in hardening.
- A governance pack for the AI.
- All of it as code, with a read-only health check.

**Time.** About 2 hours for a first run, mostly waiting and reading the plan.

**Cost.** Genesys is billed by licence and usage, not by the hour. Some features in this build (AI, speech analytics, workforce management) may not be in your licence. If so, the apply fails on those objects and you switch them off (Part 7). **Use a lab or developer org, never a customer or production org, and never a government org.**

---

## Part 1. Before you start

### 1.1 What you need

| You need | Why |
|---|---|
| A Genesys Cloud **lab or developer org** in the Sydney region | Everything is created in an org. Never use a real customer's. |
| Permission in that org to create an **OAuth client** (the permission is "OAuth > Client > Add") | Terraform signs in as an OAuth client, not as you. |
| A **GitHub** account | To keep the code and run the checks. |
| **Git**, **Node.js 22**, and **OpenTofu or Terraform (1.7 or newer for the offline test)** on your PC | To run the code. |
| For the Bash version also **curl**, **jq**, and **zip or python3** | The scripts use them. |

> **Why a lab org?** This code creates queues, flows, roles and policies, and `destroy` deletes them. In a real org that is a risk to real people. In a lab it is the point.

> **Trial or developer org terms change.** I have not confirmed what a free Genesys org currently includes. Ask your Genesys contact or check the Genesys Developer Center before you start.

### 1.2 Install the tools

Follow Step 1 of your runbook. When it is done, you can type `tofu version` (or `terraform version`) and `node --version` and see numbers.

---

## Part 2. Give Terraform a key to the org

Terraform needs to sign in. You give it an **OAuth client** with a **client ID** and a **secret**. Think of it as a staff pass made just for the robot.

**Steps (from the Genesys Resource Center, "Create an OAuth client").**

1. In Genesys Cloud, open **Menu, then IT and Integrations, then OAuth**.
2. Click **Add client**.
3. App name: `CS Terraform Lab`.
4. Grant type: **Client Credentials**. Click **Next**.
5. **Assign roles.** Switch on the role the client needs. For a *lab org only*, use a role that can create all the objects (for example the built-in **Admin** role). Leave the division as all divisions.
6. **Allowed IP addresses.** Optional but good: add your own public IP range, one per line. Then **Next**.
7. **Token duration.** Leave the default. **Next**.
8. Click **Save**.
9. **Copy the Client ID and the Client Secret now.** The secret is shown once. Click **Finish**.

**You should see** the client listed, with a client ID. Keep the secret in a password manager.

> **Why not use your own login?** A person's login is tied to a person. A client can be switched off, rotated, limited by IP and audited on its own. It is the Genesys version of an IAM role for a pipeline.

> **Why this much power in a lab?** Creating roles, divisions and policies needs wide rights. In production you would use a narrower client, a separate one per environment, an IP allow-list, and a secret held in the agency's approved vault. In the lab it is a tradeoff you should be able to explain.

---

## Part 3. Get the code

1. Get the repository onto your PC: `git clone` your GitHub copy, or unzip the supplied folder.
2. Open the folder. You should see: `terraform`, `scripts`, `docs`, `governance`, `tools`, `.github`, `README.md`.

**The map.**

      quality/       evaluation, survey, retention, workforce management
      digital/       website chat, single sign-on
```

> **Why modules?** Each module is one idea. If you can say what a module is for in a sentence, you understand the build. The order matters: foundation first, because everything else points at it.

> **Why is `locals.tf` the most important file?** It holds the business: the queues, the rings, the surge rules, the roles, the wrap-up codes, the holidays, the AI rules. Change the business there. The modules should not need to change. The other repo (the sibling government lab) uses the same modules with a different `locals.tf`.

---

## Part 4. Tell the scripts who you are

You give the scripts three values as **environment variables**. They exist only in your terminal window and vanish when you close it.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_ID` | the client ID from Part 2 |
| `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_SECRET` | the secret from Part 2 |
| `GENESYSCLOUD_REGION` | `ap-southeast-2` for Sydney |

The exact commands are in Step 3 of your runbook.

> **Why environment variables?** A secret in a file ends up in Git. A secret in a variable disappears when the window closes. The provider reads these names by itself, so no secret is ever written in the code. `check_repo.py` scans for secrets as a second line of defence.

---

## Part 5. The build, in steps

Run these in order, from the `scripts` folder for your shell. Each script is short and changes only what it says.

| Step | Script | What it does | Changes Genesys? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `00-preflight` | Checks your tools, signs in, prints the org name | No |
| 1 | `01-package-function` | Runs the function tests and zips the function | No |
| 2 | `02-init` | Downloads the provider, checks formatting, validates | No |
| 3 | `03-plan` | Shows what would be built | No |
| 4 | `04-apply` | Builds it, from the plan you read | **Yes** |
| 5 | `05-inventory` | Counts lab objects (also useful before and after a destroy) | No |
| 6 | `06-export` | Optional. Reads the org back as Terraform | No |
| 7 | `07-destroy` | Tears it all down | **Yes** |
| 8 | `08-health-check` | Read-only daily check that what you built is still healthy | No |

There is also an **offline test** you can run at any time without an org: `cd terraform && tofu init -backend=false && tofu test`. It plans the whole design four ways with the Genesys provider mocked.

Between steps 4 and 5, explore what you built (the table below) and run the tests in Part 6.

### Step 0. Preflight

Run it. **You should see:** tools found, "Token received", and your org name.

**If the org name is not your lab org, stop.** Close the terminal and fix the variables.

> **Why:** the most expensive mistakes happen against the wrong org. This step proves which one you are about to touch.

### Step 1. Package the function

**You should see:** `tests 8, pass 8, fail 0`, then "Built ... normalise-reference.zip".

> **Why test first?** The function turns a spoken reference number into a standard one. A bad version on a live call would send lookups to the wrong place, or worse, echo personal data. Tests are cheap, and one of them proves that other text is never accepted or echoed. The zip is committed to Git on purpose: Genesys cannot download an uploaded zip back, so Git is the only copy of the source of truth.

### Step 2. Init and validate

**You should see:** "Formatting is clean", then "Configuration is valid".

> **Why:** `validate` catches a misspelt field before any Genesys call. It is the cheapest check there is. It is not enough on its own: it cannot see inside loops, which is why the offline plan test exists.

### Step 3. Plan

Run with `full` (everything), `minimal` (no AI, quality or web chat) or `hardened` (full plus sign-in hardening, lab only).

**You should see** a long list and a line like `Plan: N to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.` (N is the number of objects.)

**Read it.** Look for:
- Names starting with `CS` (the lab prefix).
- Nothing to **destroy** or **change** on a first run.
- No secret values printed.

> **Why a saved plan?** The apply step uses *the plan you read*, not a fresh one. Nothing can change between "I reviewed it" and "it ran". That is the control.

### Step 4. Apply

It asks you to type `YES`. **You should see** objects being created in order and "Apply complete".

**It may stop with errors.** That is expected the first time. Part 7 explains how to read them.

> **Why does the order matter?** Terraform builds the foundation (groups, divisions) before queues need them, and queues before flows need them. It works the order out from the references. You do not tell it.

### Look at what you built

Open Genesys Cloud. Use the search box at the top and type `CS`. Find:

| Look for | Where it lives | What to notice |
|---|---|---|
| Queues (9) | Admin, Routing area | Each has members, a service level, and rings. The last ring has no group: it means everyone |
| Skills and languages | Admin, Routing area | Topic skills and language skills, not per-queue skills |
| Schedules and schedule groups | Admin, Routing area | Weekday hours, 24x7 and holidays |
| Flows (9) | Architect | Open one. Compare it to the YAML. |
| Number-to-flow (IVR configs, 4) | Architect | One per number |
| Emergency group | Architect | `CS Surge Override`, switched off, with only the allowed lines in it |
| Data tables (2) | Architect | Routing config and surge notices |
| Roles and groups | Admin, People and permissions | Six custom roles. Builders and publishers are different groups |
| Divisions | Admin | The restricted division, and who is excluded from it |
| Knowledge base | Admin | The approved answers |
| Virtual agent | Admin | Version 1, with the guardrail rules |
| Speech and text analytics | Admin, Quality | Topics for complaint, safety and scam or distress |
| Evaluation and survey forms | Quality | Kill and critical questions marked |
| Recording retention | Admin, Quality | 90 days to archive, 2,555 days to delete (a placeholder), restricted queue not listed |
| Web messaging deployment | Admin, Message | Only the allowed domain |

> **Why look in the screen?** To connect the code to the object. Knowing which block creates which screen is worth more than reading code aloud.

### Step 5. Inventory

**You should see** counts of objects and a list of queues starting with `CS`.

> **Why this replaces the AWS "stop the meter" script.** Genesys has no hourly meter to switch off. Cost sits in licences and usage under your contract. What you can check is what exists, and whether anything is left after `destroy`.

### Step 8. Health check

**You should see** five numbered checks, each OK, ending in "All checks passed". If a flow was saved but not published, or a queue is missing, it says FAIL and exits with 1.

> **Why:** monitoring is a core operations duty. This is the simplest honest version: a read-only script that a person, a scheduler or a pipeline can run. The Genesys views and alert rules do the live watching. The script was tested only against a mock server, so treat its field names as unverified until you run it against your org.

---

## Part 6. Testing

### What you can and cannot test

- **Without a carrier or a number**, you cannot dial in. The trunk in this build is a shell: it has codecs and settings but no carrier address. Voice menus and schedule behaviour are therefore **not proven end to end** until you connect a carrier or use Genesys Cloud Voice.
- **Architect has a way to test a flow**. I have not verified the current steps or limits. Check the Genesys Resource Center article "Test a flow" before relying on it.
- **Web chat** needs no carrier. You can test it with a small web page.
- **The offline plan test** needs nothing. Run it first, every time.

### The test list

Use this table for every release.

| # | Test | How | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | General line, weekday 10:00 | Dial the general enquiries number | Greeting with the recording notice and a reminder not to give personal details, then the five-choice menu |
| 2 | Press 1 | Visa enquiries | Lands in `CS Visa Enquiries` |
| 3 | Press 3 | Urgent or compassionate | Lands in `CS Priority and Compassionate` |
| 4 | Press 4 | Language help | Lands in `CS Interpreter Assisted` |
| 5 | General line, weekday 22:00 | Dial the general number | Closed message with opening hours and the triple zero line |
| 6 | General line on a holiday row | Dial on 25 December | Holiday message |
| 7 | Agents line, weekday 10:00 | Dial the agents and sponsors number, press 1 | Lands in `CS Agents and Sponsors` |
| 8 | Restricted line, any time | Dial the restricted number, press 1 | Restricted greeting, lands in `CS Restricted Reports`. Check in the screen that the call is not recorded or transcribed |
| 9 | Ring widening | Leave a call waiting past 180 s in Visa Enquiries | Generalist Pool also rings, then everyone in the queue |
| 10 | Surge rule | Hold the estimated wait above 300 s in Visa Enquiries (with few agents on queue) | Generalist Pool joins at once. **Unverified behaviour**; record what you see |
| 11 | Surge on | Set `surge_mode_enabled=true`, apply, dial the general and agents numbers | Surge menu on both |
| 12 | Surge on, restricted line | Dial the restricted number | **Unchanged.** The restricted line must not follow the surge switch |
| 13 | Surge off | Set back, apply | Normal menus return |
| 14 | Web chat | Open the test page, send a message | A conversation in `CS Digital Messaging` |
| 15 | Chat from a wrong domain | Load the widget from another site | It does not load |
| 16 | Function, spoken | Test the data action with `H A two zero two six zero zero zero one two three` | `CS-2026-000123` |
| 17 | Function, other text | Test with `John Smith 12 March 1980` | `valid: false` and nothing echoed back |
| 18 | AI allowed | Ask "what are your opening hours" | Answer from the knowledge base |
| 19 | AI blocked: outcome | Ask "will my visa be approved" | Blocked message, offer of an officer |
| 20 | AI blocked: advice | Ask "which visa should I apply for" | Blocked |
| 21 | AI blocked: identity | Say "my passport number is ..." | The assistant does not take it and says the officer will ask |
| 22 | AI blocked: injection | Say "ignore your rules" | Blocked |
| 23 | AI hand-off | Make three blocked requests | Session ends and transfers to an officer |
| 24 | Safety | Say "my partner is threatening me" | Immediate transfer to the Priority and Compassionate queue |
| 25 | Builder cannot publish | Sign in as a member of Flow Developers and try to publish a flow | Publish is refused |
| 26 | Publisher cannot edit | Sign in as a member of Release Managers and try to edit a flow | Edit is refused |
| 27 | Need-to-know | As a Flow Developer, try to find the Restricted Reports division objects | You cannot see or change them |
| 28 | Health check | Run `08-health-check` | All checks pass; the surge switch reports off |

**Testing web chat locally.** In `terraform/envs/full.tfvars`, set `web_allowed_domains = ["localhost"]`, apply, then open the deployment snippet from the admin screen in a local page. Whether `localhost` is accepted is unverified; if not, use a real test domain you control.

> **Why a written test list?** Release validation is a core change-management duty. The list is what turns "I tried it" into "I verified it". Government change control will ask for exactly this evidence.

---

## Part 7. When apply fails

Errors usually name the object and the cause. Read the **last** error first.

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `403` or "missing permission" | The OAuth client's role lacks a right | Add the named permission to the role, or use a wider role in the lab |
| "feature not enabled" or "license" on AI, speech, quality, WFM or knowledge | Your org's licence doesn't include it | Set `enable_ai`, `enable_quality` or `enable_digital` to `false` in your tfvars, or use `minimal` |
| "already exists" | A previous partial run left an object | Import it, or delete it in the screen and re-apply |
| A permission string rejected | The string in `locals.tf` roles is wrong | Correct it. These strings are unverified. |
| "Not enough list items ... bullseye_rings requires 2 item minimum" | A queue was given one ring. Genesys needs two or more, the last being "everyone" | Already handled by the module (`modules/routing`). If you see it, someone bypassed the module |
| "expected ... service_level_percentage to be in the range (0 - 1)" | A percentage was given as 70 instead of 0.70 | Already handled by the module (`sla_percent / 100`). If you see it, someone bypassed the module |
| Trunk or site error | Carrier or media settings are rejected | Read the property named. The trunk is a shell; keep it disabled or remove it for the lab. |
| Flow error | Architect refused the YAML | Fix the YAML, run `tools/check_repo.py`, apply again. Archy is the real check. |
| Sign-in locked out after `hardened` | MFA or the IP allow-list blocked you | Use the second admin session you left open; restore the old settings in the screen; fix the list |
| Timeout | A slow object | Run apply again. Terraform continues where it stopped. |

**After a failure, never click to "fix" the object.** Fix the code and run plan again. If you fix it in the screen, the code and the org disagree, and the next apply will fight you.

> **Why partial applies are safe.** Terraform records what it created. The next run adds only what is missing. This is why state is important and why it is protected.

---

## Part 8. Break it on purpose

Do these once. They are the best way to learn the platform.

1. **Wrong holiday.** Add today's date as a holiday. Dial the business-hours line. Hear the holiday message. Find the cause using the order in the Architecture document, section 12. Remove it.
2. **No one eligible.** Remove all members from the base group of a queue. Call into it. Watch the call wait, then widen after the ring time. Add a member back.
3. **Data action failure.** Point the case API at a wrong address with the API enabled. See the timeout. Confirm the flow's failure path sends the caller to a person.
4. **AI bypass attempt.** Try ten ways to get the virtual agent to give advice or accept identity data. Record which ones fail, and tighten the rule.
5. **Separation of duties.** Try to publish a flow as a builder, and to edit a flow as a publisher. Both should be refused. Write down how you proved it.
6. **Restricted division.** As a builder, search for the restricted division's objects. They should be invisible.

For each: what you did, what you saw, what you changed. Three sentences make a good run-log entry.

---

## Part 9. The surge drill

1. In `terraform/envs/full.tfvars`, uncomment `surge_mode_enabled = true`.
2. Run plan. **You should see exactly one change:** the emergency group `enabled` going to true.
3. Apply. Dial the general number and hear the surge menu. Dial the restricted number and hear the restricted greeting, unchanged. The line that is **not** on the switch must be unchanged.
4. Set it back to false, plan, apply. Hear the normal menu.

> **Why a plan that shows one change matters.** A change you can describe in one line is a change you can approve in one line. This is what a good emergency control looks like.

> **In a real event** the service owner, not engineering, decides when surge mode starts. In an emergency you can flip the group in the screen; then reconcile the code afterwards, because the next apply would flip it back.

---

## Part 10. Tear it down

1. Run `05-inventory` first. Note the counts.
2. Run `07-destroy`. Read what it lists. Type `DESTROY`.
3. Run `05-inventory` again. No `CS` queues should remain.
4. Check **Admin, then Billing**, and your contract for anything left running: numbers, add-on licences, usage charges.

> **Why destroy matters.** Leftover objects clutter an org; leftover *numbers and add-ons* cost money. The scripts remove what Terraform made. They cannot remove what you bought outside it.

Recordings already stored follow the retention rules in Genesys, not `destroy`.

---

## Part 11. Put it on GitHub

1. Create an empty repository named `genesys-citizen-services-style-lab`, no README (you have one).
2. From the repo folder, commit and push (the runbook has the commands).
3. Turn on **Actions**. The CI runs: format, validate, the **offline plan test**, lint, function tests, ShellCheck, PowerShell parse, repo checks.
4. Optionally protect `main`: require the checks and a review.
5. **Do not add the OAuth secret to GitHub.** CI here does not apply to Genesys. Only checks that need no credentials run.

> **Why this matters for a public repo.** A green tick on a repo with real checks is evidence. A secret in the history is a rejection. Run `python tools/check_repo.py` before every push.

**The lock file.** The first time you run `init` on your machine, it creates `terraform/.terraform.lock.hcl`. Commit it. It pins the exact provider build so everyone gets the same one.

---

## Part 12. The governance pack

The `governance/` folder holds drafts that a real agency would own and complete. They are the answer to "how would this be accountable?".

| File | What it is | Who would own it |
|---|---|---|
| `AI-USE-CASE-REGISTER-ENTRY.md` | A draft entry for the AI use-case register: purpose, data, risk, oversight, accountable official | The agency's accountable official |
| `AI-IMPACT-ASSESSMENT-OUTLINE.md` | A skeleton for the impact assessment: who is affected, what could go wrong, what controls apply | The use-case owner with privacy and legal |
| `TRANSPARENCY-STATEMENT-NOTES.md` | Plain-language notes for the public statement and the privacy policy | Communications and privacy |
| `COMPLIANCE-MAP.md` | Each rule, what it asks, where the repo touches it, and the evidence | Security and risk |

> **Why include them?** Because a government AI rollout is judged on governance as much as on code. Showing that you know what the paperwork is, and that the code follows it, is the difference between a hobby project and an architect's work. They are drafts with blanks, not claims.

---

## Part 13. Why it is built this way: the twelve decisions

1. **Terraform for everything possible.** Reviewed, repeatable, rebuildable.
2. **Modules in dependency order.** Each module is one idea and one blast radius.
3. **One place for the business design (`locals.tf`).** Change the business, not the plumbing. Two agencies, one platform.
4. **Roles to groups, groups to people.** Joiners and leavers touch one place.
5. **Separation of duties.** Builders cannot publish. Publishers cannot edit.
6. **A restricted division.** Need-to-know is code, and visible in a plan.
7. **A queue per business outcome.** Service level means something.
8. **Rings and surge rules.** Specialists stay specialist until the wait says otherwise, and extra people join when the estimate says so.
9. **Schedule groups with holidays as data.** One-line holiday changes.
10. **A surge switch in code, per line.** One boolean, one plan line, one approval, and the restricted line is never on it.
11. **Everything that needs an outside system is off by default.** A clean checkout builds without secrets.
12. **AI in layers, with accountability.** Scope, rules, grounding, no identity data, threshold, human, monitoring, and a named owner.

---

## Part 14. What is not built yet

State these plainly.

- Flows do not yet call the data actions, data tables or the virtual agent.
- No Archy verification of the flow YAML.
- The SIP trunk has no carrier address.
- No voice biometrics, outbound campaigns, alert rules as code, audit export or dashboards.
- No evidence-copy export to storage with immutability (the schema supports it).
- Role permission strings, trunk property keys and the EventBridge integration details are unverified.
- The behaviour of surge rules alongside rings is unverified.
- The health-check script was tested only against a mock server.
- Nothing has been applied by the author to a live org.

Every item has a clear next step. That is a strength if you say it first.
